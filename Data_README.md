# Data for Short-Term Alpha Project

The data files for this project are not included in this GitHub repository because they are very large.

## How to Get the Data:

1.  Go to: https://lobsterdata.com
2.  Sign up for a free account.
3.  Download the "Sample Data" for AAPL (Apple Inc.).
4.  Choose a date and a 1-hour time window (e.g., 2022-06-01, from 10:00 to 11:00).
5.  Download the "Orderbook" file (10 levels is good).
6.  Place the downloaded CSV file in this `data` folder.
7.  Rename the file to: `AAPL_orderbook_with_features.csv`

After you do this, you can run the code!
